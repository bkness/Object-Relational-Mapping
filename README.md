# Object Relational Mapping 

## Description 
This project involves developing an e-commerce back-end system using Sequelize ORM with Express.js. The application allows users to interact with the database to view, create, update, and delete relevant data. It features a well-structured schema, efficient routing, and comprehensive CRUD functionalities.

## Installation 
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:<br>
`npm install`

## Usage
To use the application, follow these steps:

1. Install the required packages using the `npm install` command.

2. Seed the database with the sample data:<br>
`npm run seed`

3. Start the server:<br>
`npm start`

4. Once the server is running, you can view and manipulate the data using Insomnia or any other API client by sending requests to the appropriate routes. 

## Test 
All routes were tested using Insomnia to ensure they function correctly. The following CRUD operations were tested:

* Create: Adding new entries to the database.

* Read: Retrieving Data from the database.

* Update: Modifying existing entries in the database.

* Delete: Removing entries from the database.

### Model Associations 

The application uses Sequelize to define relationships between models. The associations are set up as follows:

    const Product = require('./Product');
    const Category = require('./Category');
    const Tag = require('./Tag');
    const ProductTag = require('./ProductTag');

    // Products belong to Category
    Product.belongsTo(Category, {
    foreignKey: 'category_id',
    onDelete: 'CASCADE'
    });

    // Categories have many Products
    Category.hasMany(Product, {
    foreignKey: 'category_id'
    });

    // Products belong to many Tags (through ProductTag)
    Product.belongsToMany(Tag, {
    through: ProductTag,
    foreignKey: 'product_id'
    });

    // Tags belong to many Products (through ProductTag)
    Tag.belongsToMany(Product, {
    through: ProductTag,
    foreignKey: 'tag_id'
    });

    module.exports = {
    Product,
    Category,
    Tag,
    ProductTag,
    };

These associations ensure that:

* A product belongs to a category.

* A category can have many products.

* A product can have many tags through `ProductTag` model.

* A tag can belong to many products through the `ProductTag` model.
